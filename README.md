# emacs.d

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/andrebeat/emacs.d/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/andrebeat/emacs.d)

This is my personal Emacs config. I use this mainly on OS X with GNU Emacs 25.1 and also on Arch
Linux.

This configuration is optimized for *my* use and therefore I wouldn't recommend it as it is to
someone else, but it could however have some small gem that is useful to you.

I decided to experiment with using [`use-package`][use-package] to manage and configure
dependencies. Most of the config is actually made of [`use-package`][use-package] blocks. This has
the advantage of making configuration of packages consistent and also performant since most
dependencies are lazy loaded.

Additionally, I wanted to make my setup as simple as possible and therefore decided to try having
all my config in just one file. In order to get around the file I use `outline-minor-mode` with
[`outshine`](https://github.com/tj64/outshine) to fold sections like in `org-mode`. This
is what it looks like:

![outshine init](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7018537/emacs-init.gif)

I've also started using [`evil-mode`][evil-mode] for "vim-like" editing coupled with
[`evil-leader`](https://github.com/cofi/evil-leader) for ergonomic keybindings.

## Keybindings

These are my personal keybindings as reported by [`use-package`][use-package]'s function
`describe-personal-keybindings`.

### Evil Leader

I set my leader key to `SPC` since it's pressed with the thumb.

Key binding | Command
----------- | -------------------------------------
**global**  |
`SPC s`     | `save-buffer`
`SPC k`     | `kill-this-buffer`
`SPC d`     | `delete-window`
`SPC b`     | `ivy-switch-buffer`
`SPC f`     | `counsel-find-files`
`SPC g`     | `magit-status`
`SPC v`     | `expand-region`
            |
`SPC รง`     | `evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-lines`
`SPC ci`    | `evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-lines`
`SPC cl`    | `evilnc-quick-comment-or-uncomment-to-the-line`
`SPC cc`    | `evilnc-copy-and-comment-lines`
`SPC cp`    | `evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-paragraphs`
`SPC cr`    | `comment-or-uncomment-region`
`SPC cv`    | `evilnc-toggle-invert-comment-line-by-line`
            |
`SPC p p`   | `counsel-projectile`
`SPC p f`   | `counsel-projectile-find-file`
`SPC p a`   | `counsel-projectile-ag`
            |
`SPC j j`   | `avy-goto-char`
`SPC j w`   | `avy-goto-word-or-subword-1`
`SPC j l`   | `avy-goto-line`
`SPC j b`   | `avy-pop-mark`
**scala-mode-map** |
`SPC .`     | `ensime-edit-definition`
`SPC p c`   | `ensime-sbt-do-compile`
**rust-mode-map** |
`SPC .`     | `racer-find-definition`

Since [`evil-mode`][evil-mode] relies on `Esc` to switch back to normal state, I have set up my `Caps
Lock` key to act as `Esc` when tapped and as `Ctrl` when pressed.

## Credits

I have used Bozhidar Batsov's config for a long time and this config borrows a lot of knowledge (and
some code) from [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude). Additionally, I've also found some of
[Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs)'s layers to be very useful.
